Here we investigate whether cognitive decline is affected by interaction between these two risk factors. Specifically, we examine whether APOE*ε4 moderates the association between high blood pressure and cognition in later life. Cognitive function was assessed at three time points over a period of 8 years in 1,474 cognitively normal, community-dwelling adults aged 60-64 years at baseline. Blood pressure and APOE genotype were assessed at baseline. Blood pressure was measured categorically as 'Hypertension' and continuously as 'Mean Arterial Pressure' (MAP). Multilevel models were used to investigate main and interactive effects of APOE genotype and both hypertension and MAP on the rate of change of episodic memory, working memory, verbal ability, perceptual speed, and global cognition. The APOE-hypertension interaction was associated with a small but statistically significant increase in the rate of decline of episodic memory, verbal ability, and global cognition. However, its inclusion in the model did not increase the amount of outcome variation explained beyond that already explained by the effect of time. In contrast, the APOE-MAP interaction had no effect on the rate of decline in any of these domains of cognitive performance. These results provide tentative evidence that APOE genotype moderates the association between high blood pressure and cognitive decline in later life.}},

This is the first exploratory study to examine whether AD genetic loci as a genetic risk score (GRS), or individually, are a shared risk factor with MBI. Participants were 1,226 older adults (aged 72-79; 738 males; 763 normal cognition) from the Personality and Total Health Through Life project. MBI was approximated in accordance with Criterion 1 of the ISTAART-AA diagnostic criteria using a transformation algorithm for the neuropsychiatric inventory. A GRS was constructed from 25 AD risk loci. Binomial logistic regression adjusting for age, gender, and education examined the association between GRS and MBI. A higher GRS and APOE*ε4 were associated with increased likelihood of affective dysregulation. Nominally significant associations were observed between MS4A4A-rs4938933*C and MS4A6A-rs610932*G with a reduced likelihood of affective dysregulation; ZCWPW1-rs1476679*C with a reduced likelihood of social inappropriateness and abnormal perception/thought content; BIN1-rs744373*G and EPHA1-rs11767557*C with higher likelihood of abnormal perception/thought content; NME8-rs2718058*G with a reduced likelihood of decreased motivation.

              instruments for the exposures were selected from genome wide

              tangles, and vascular brain injury (VBI). MR estimates were

We conducted a systematic review of studies investigating the association of non-APOE LOAD risk loci with cognitive performance in older adults. Studies published from January 2009 to April 2018 were identified through a PubMed database search using keywords and by scanning reference lists. Studies were included if they were either cross-sectional or longitudinal in design, included at least one genome-wide significant LOAD risk loci or a genetic risk score, and had one objective measure of cognition. Quality assessment of the studies was conducted using the quality of genetic studies (Q-Genie) tool. Of 2,466 studies reviewed, 49 met inclusion criteria. Fifteen percent of the associations between non-APOE LOAD risk loci and cognition were significant. However, these associations were not replicated across studies, and the majority were rendered non-significant when adjusting for multiple testing. One-third of the studies included genetic risk scores, and these were typically significant only when APOE was included. The findings of this systematic review do not support a consistent association between individual non-APOE LOAD risk and cognitive performance or decline. However, evidence suggests that aggregate LOAD genetic risk exerts deleterious effects on decline in episodic memory and global cognition.}},

  abstract = {{ Introduction Observational studies have suggested that light-to-moderate alcohol consumption decreases the risk of Alzheimer's disease, but it is unclear if this association is causal. Methods Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was used to examine whether alcohol consumption, alcohol dependence, or Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT) scores were causally associated with the risk of Late-Onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) or Alzheimer's disease age of onset survival (AAOS). Additionally, γ-glutamyltransferase levels were included as a positive control. Results There was no evidence of a causal association between alcohol consumption, alcohol dependence, or AUDIT, and LOAD. Alcohol consumption was associated with an earlier AAOS and increased γ-glutamyltransferase blood concentrations. Alcohol dependence was associated with a delayed AAOS. Discussion MR found robust evidence of a causal association between alcohol consumption and an earlier AAOS, but not alcohol intake and LOAD risk. The protective effect of alcohol dependence is potentially due to survivor bias.}},
